            <h2 class="heading-large">The Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave
                Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. </p>
            <p>Constructed from 1887â€“89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading
                artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable
                structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended
                it in 2015.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-medium">Construction of the Eiffel Tower</h3>
            <p>Foundations of the Eiffel Tower Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were
                straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of
                each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles
                installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72
                ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone
                with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.</p>
