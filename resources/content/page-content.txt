Time To Travel is lead by the amazing team of Sally, Mike and Josh.

Sally Smith
Sally travelled the world for over a decade before starting Time To Travel. 

She specialises in both leisure and corporate travel, and her favourite place to holiday is Venice.

Mike Miller
Mike's passion for travel began over 20 years ago when he backpacked around Australia after leaving school.

He specialises in outback adventures and is the only person in the office to have completed the Kokoda Track.

Josh Jones
Josh is the connections guru in the office. He once flew around the world in 40 hours, just to prove that he could.
